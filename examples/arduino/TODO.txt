This example has been copied from another project. It doesn't
work just yet...

The idea is to be able to drop an arduino sketch into the
'sketch' directory, and be able to build with minimal
configuration.

to do:
- build core from source in arduino dir - don't need to copy
  core source to this project

- create 'arduino_utils' in doit_tools, comprising most of the
  information currently in this example's dodo.py file. Will need
  functions like arduino_utils.set_arduino_path(),
  arduino_utils.set_hardware(), etc...
